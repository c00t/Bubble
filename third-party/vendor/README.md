# Vendored Libraries

There are many reasons to vendored some libraries.

1. They will be used across dynamic libraries boundary, and make use of thread locals or statics to achieve their functionality.
   The methods they expose operate normally depend on synchronization of these thread locals or statics.
2. The macros they expose can't be reexport through `pub use` with hardcoded `::crate_name`, you should always import them directly.
3. Some libraries rely on the properties which are consistent across **one** compilation, such as `core::any::type_id`. To be used in
   bubble, only properties which are consistent across **multiple** compilation with **fixed** compiler can be used, such as rust abi.
   see [the question](https://users.rust-lang.org/t/prefer-dynamic-yes-in-hot-reload-or-plugin-system/115364/2?u=c00t) I asked on user forum.
